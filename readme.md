# Node Virtual Classroom REST

## Initial Setup

1. Start by creating a MongoDB database named `virtual-classroom`.

2. Execute the `userscreate.js` file to establish entries for users. (Alternatively, users can be created through the `/register` endpoint.)

3. Tables will be automatically generated when the Node.js project starts since models are already defined

4. Run the following command to initiate the Node.js project:
     ```
     node server.js
     ```

5. Make use of the provided Postman collection by importing it into your Postman workspace.
